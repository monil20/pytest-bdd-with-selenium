Feature: DuckDuckGo Web Browsing
    As a web surfer,
    I want to find information online,
    So I can learn new things and get tasks done.

    # Web scenarios can be highly declarative, which focuses on behavior.
    # Don't get caught up in button names and layouts at the Gherkin level.
    # Note that these scenarios use Selenium WebDriver to do browser interactions.

    Background:
        Given the DuckDuckGo home page is displayed

    Scenario: Basic DuckDuckGo Search
        When the user searches for "panda"
        Then results are shown for "panda"
